# read-mapping-code-amoA
Read mapping metagenomic reads to assembled amoA sequences and counting mapped reads.
This script was used in a Master's thesis project, and is intended to be used specifically for the data generated in that project. The code is here to allow for reproducibility. This script is not intended to be used for generic sequencing data.

This script is based off of the [ATLAS-extensions](https://github.com/jmtsuji/atlas-extensions) script by Jackson Tsuji.
